            <b>A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage.</b>
        </h2>
        <p>Some cultures have adopted the traditional Western custom of the white wedding, in which a bride wears a white wedding dress and veil. This tradition was popularized through the marriage of Queen Victoria.[1] Some say Victoria's choice of a white gown may have simply been a sign of extravagance, but may have also been influenced by the values she held which emphasized sexual purity.[2]

            The use of a wedding ring has long been part of religious weddings in Europe and America, but the origin of the tradition is unclear. One possibility is the Roman belief in the Vena amoris, which was believed to be a blood vessel that ran from the fourth finger (ring finger) directly to the heart. Thus, when a couple wore rings on this finger, their hearts were connected. Historian Vicki Howard points out that the belief in the "ancient" quality of the practice is most likely a modern invention.[3] In the United States of America, a groom's wedding band has not appeared until the early 20th century,[4] while in Europe it has been part of the tradition since the ancient Romans, as witnessed by the jurist Gaius.</p>
